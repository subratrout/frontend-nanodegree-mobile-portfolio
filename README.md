In this project the challenge is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the critical rendering path techniques. [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

The Project comprises of three sample sub-projects.

The third project is a pizza resaturant website.In order to optimize the website following actions were taken.

1. All of the images were resized for image optimzation.

2. CSS file was moved as inline and javascript file was set to load asynchronously.

3. For bootstrap css I used Grunt uncss to take out unnecessary css selectors and keep only those are used in the application and added as inline CSS to application.

4. Javascript file was minified.

5. Number of DOM calls were reduced to decrease the page load time.
